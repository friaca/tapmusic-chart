# tapmusic-chart
Just an script for automating the monthly task of downloading that month's chart.

_I tested this with Python 3.8, but I'm pretty sure it will work with any Python 3+ version._
## Usage

- Clone the repo with 

```git clone https://github.com/friaca/tapmusic-chart.git```

- Change `username` variable to your Last.FM username
- Change `download_path` variable to your desired path
- Run with 

```python tapmusic.py```

- Be happy
